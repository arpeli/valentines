# Valentine Message Assignment

A web-based project for Fundamentals of Internet, creating a Valentine-themed page with interactive buttons and a futuristic hacker-themed About page.

## Features
- Personalized Valentine message with name input via a modal, styled in pink and red with a cute, romantic aesthetic.
- YES/NO buttons to display different GIFs (`happy.gif`, `heartbreak.gif`) with heart animations.
- Responsive navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact, using pink/red tones on Home and Contact, neon on About.
- About page with a cyberpunk hacker vibe, featuring matrix rain, neon styling, and curated punchlines for group members.
- Contact form with a Valentine-themed design for user feedback (demo alert, no backend).
- Responsive design with media queries for all devices.
- Glitch animations and neon effects on the About page.
